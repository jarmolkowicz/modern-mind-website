# Modern Mind Website Copy (Feb 2026)

## Hero

**Title:** Modern Mind — Knowledge Base for the AI Age

**Subtitle:** Built for people who advise teams on AI adoption, design trainings, write AI policies, create content.

**Primary CTA:** Get the Knowledge Pack
**Secondary CTA:** Browse on GitHub

---

## Problem

AI is reshaping how we think, decide, and work. Understanding this well enough to teach it, write about it, or shape policy around it is hard. The field is new, research is scattered, and AI itself gives shallow answers on this topic.

We collected the research, named the key ideas, and organized everything into a knowledge base. Give it to your AI, and build real things, a workshop, a policy, an article. All grounded in curated research and best practices.

---

## How It Works

The knowledge base lives on GitHub — browse it, contribute to it, build on it. The knowledge pack is one downloadable file you give to your AI.

1. **Download** — One file. The full knowledge pack bundled into a single markdown, updated with every new entry.
2. **Give it to your AI** — Drop it into Claude Projects, NotebookLM, a Custom GPT, or any AI assistant that lets you upload files.
3. **Prompt** — Design a training, draft a policy, write an article — with AI grounded in research instead of generic knowledge.

---

## Try These Prompts

Once your AI has the knowledge pack as context, try prompting it:

- **Design a training** — "Using the KB, design a 2-hour workshop for senior consultants on cognitive risks of AI adoption"
- **Draft a policy** — "Using the KB, draft an AI use policy that addresses Borrowed Certainty and Automation Bias for our team"
- **Write with depth** — "Using the KB, help me write a LinkedIn post about why our consulting deliverables feel hollow. Ground it in research."
- **Review an AI workflow** — "Using the KB, review this AI workflow and flag where cognitive offloading risks are highest"
- **Onboard a team** — "Using the KB, create a 30-minute briefing on the key cognitive risks for someone joining an AI-heavy team"

**CTA (repeat):** Get the Knowledge Pack

## What's Inside

Research on AI and human thinking — structured for your AI to use as context, or for you to browse directly.

- **Concepts** — Named phenomena: cognitive debt, fluency bias, jagged frontier, and 35 more
- **Frameworks** — Decision models for when to use AI and when to think independently
- **Practices** — Methods for preserving thinking capacity: think-first, calibration, strategic alternation
- **Sources** — 30+ curated papers with key findings and full citations

---

## How It's Built

- **Evidence-first** — Every concept ties back to research, documented practice, or professional insight. Status-tagged so you know the confidence level.
- **Readable by you and your AI** — Consistent formatting, metadata, and cross-references across every entry.
- **Open source** — MIT licensed. Use it, fork it, build on it. Knowledge about how AI affects thinking shouldn't be locked behind a paywall.

---

## Why Open Source

- **Emerging field** — Needs diverse perspectives — practitioners, educators, and researchers who validate and contribute.
- **Urgent issue** — We quietly outsource our thinking without realizing it. AI capabilities are advancing faster than our wisdom about using them.
- **Too many frameworks** — Instead of adding to the noise, building one shared source of truth.
- **Knowledge should be open** — Not locked behind paywalls or proprietary training programs.

## Who's Behind This

I'm Paweł Jarmołkowicz. After 20 years building technology, I've become focused on how we adopt and use it wisely. Not anti-AI. Not blindly pro-AI. Pro-human.

This KB is designed to be bigger than one person's perspective. That's why it's open source.
